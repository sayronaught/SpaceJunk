im making a silly exaggerated future dystopia. full on space opera, and with companie so big its ridiculous.
now to fill up this fun world, i need advertisings, slogans and posters, possibly scripts for ads or newsclips.

All of ridicously exaggerated in some for or another, and hopefully with a meaningful twist at the end..

something like:
"Did your world get destroyed by accident or greed? Come to World 2.0!"
"Debt? fear? Existential dread? At Hooman Academy, we teach Androids how to Human."
"Seek Tower. Join Tower. Become Tower. Paid by the church of Tower."

Suggest 10 funny and morbid ad posters.
1. "Happiness is all around you - unless you have a job, in which case you can get it here!"
2. "Achieve your dreams - or at least, what we tell you to!"
3. "Life without boundaries? That's only for the rich!" 
4. "Got a problem? Get a robot! They'll do whatever you want, and never ask questions!"
5. "Need a new identity? Look no further than ID-Shift!"
6. "Brainwashed? Don't worry, the Mind-Wash will help!"
7. "The future is here! And it's full of robots!" 
8. "Tired of living in the past? Get a time machine and skip ahead!"
9. "Don't have enough money? Why not become a slave to the state?"
10. "Want to live forever? Clone yourself, and live forever in a digital world!"

something like:
