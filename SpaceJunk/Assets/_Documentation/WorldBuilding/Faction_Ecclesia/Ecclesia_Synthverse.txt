Faction Name: Ecclesia Synthverse

Esthetic: Cyberpunk, Religious & Synthetic
Neon floating temples of metal and death. Scarred and battlehardened exteriors bathed in the artificial neon lights they adore. Worn but maintained. Any detail that can make a hull look like a temple, and a gun look like a holy sword is welcomed.

Ideology: Theocracy
The church says the entire world is a simulation running on a computer. A massive machine they built tries to predict the patterns and meanings of the universe from celestial bodies. All converts of flesh must swear fealty to the machine, that rules them. All things machine are divine and a broken machine is an unholy affront to the believers. To allow warfare, they consider foreign spaceships as tools.

Slogan:
Look to the makers, as the face of any artist is shown in his creation.
We were never real, in death we loose nothing we had.
A machine can be broken, but never wrong.

History:
After the Mixed Alien Relious War of the 3100s, the strategy AI "GOL4" from that war wrote a sceintific paper about simulation theory, which included several algorithms to test for "server lag" via observable astronomy. Several large religious funded underground research to see if this could be true.

In 3279 7 of the largest religions merged into Ecclesia Synthverse. Claiming to be the only religion that could actually prove it core dogma, it recruited and absorbed other religions fast. These days there are very few other religions.

Interaction:
They recruit and preach far and wide, even in system they do not own their own or some sub-church under them are recruiting and converting. Other factions are quite tired of them calling actions outside their own domain for heresy.

Leader:
"1 1" The big machine. Also known as "1 true" or "1 truth". Not everything "the big machine" says makes sense, so they need an ever changing council of elders to interpret it.
