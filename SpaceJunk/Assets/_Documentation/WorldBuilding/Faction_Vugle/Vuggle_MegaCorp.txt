Faction Name: Vuggle MegaCorp

Esthetic: SolarPunk, Corporate & Law enforcement
Mostly painted white, to look new, but often revealing peeling paint and corroded metal underneath. Lots of solar panels, and Greenery behind glass. Many of the ships also have some "police decor", and working sirens & lights. 

Ideology: Syndicatism, Capitalism & Hegemony

Slogan:
Be evil! No seriously, be evil!
Morals waver, profits are forever.
If you cant beat them, sell them something.

History:
In 3487 Vuggle started selling life support Cribs for prenatal and extremely sick babies, and donating the yearly surplus to charities. They attracted a lot of capable employees, and as the profits rose loudly and donation dwindled silently, they embarked on corporate war with Dwight & Schultz.

The resulting merger saw Vugle buy the whole planet Emerion IV after a sham referendum where all citizens where given free cake for life to yes. A decade later they owned multiple planets and held most industry for that section of the galaxy. Recently they talk about their much publized "Operation Hyperspeed", where they simply wear out any faction by flooding their markets with cheap consumables.

Interaction:
Most people know their products, and that any stock market is heavily dominated by them. Almost half their spaceships act as "police force", even though most of these laws don't apply to themselves. Less factionless groups often have let them be "world police", but larger factions reject their ownership of their own justice departments, and their laws.

Leader:
CEO Brunk Galphon the 5th
Proudly the 5th clone of the original Galphon that led their rise to stockmarket dominance.
